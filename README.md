# Offensive Security Scripts

This repository contains quick and one-off scripts that I've created for use in bug bounties, penetration tests, and capture the flag exercises. Titles of the folders should be self explanatory, but to break down each one:

* **Bug Bounty -** Tooling I use when performing reconaissance or scanning during bug bounties over both large and small scopes.
* **CTF Trolling -** Dumb scripts that I've written for trolling the blue team in CCDC or other Red v Blue CTFs.
* **HID Attacks -** Rubber ducky and similar scripting payloads found here. These should also be compatiable with the Flipper Zero.
* **Pentesting Scripts -** Scripts I've created for use on penetration tests. Some of these are more "CTF" focused and may have been used in talks or a PoC.
